\section{Errata}
Some notes about myself:\\
\emph{In my free time, I record music. My current tech projects include hacking at Lisp, and switching my editor from vim to emacs. My focus as a Systems Administrator tends toward penetration testing and an innate drive for network security. I'm currently working on my CISSP certifications, several courses on machine learning through Coursera, and taking mathematics courses through correspondence. I consider myself a fairly straight-forward, dyed-in-the-wool sysadmin. I prefer to be contacted initially via email.}
